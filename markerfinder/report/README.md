# Compiling the report

This repository does not contain the binary files required to compile the report with figures. These will be included in the final release on GitHub.

Use `pdflatex` to compile the LaTeX source:

```
pdflatex markerfinderreport.tex
```

Make sure to compile the report twice to build the index and to resolve references.
